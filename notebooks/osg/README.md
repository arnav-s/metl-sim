# Running  metl-sim on the Open Science Pool 

The notebook [osg.ipynb](osg.ipynb) is an interactive environment for running metl-sim on the OSG Open Science Pool (OSPool). 
It allows eligible users to run molecular simulations at scale on the OSPool.

1. Create an account on the [Open Science Pool](https://portal.osg-htc.org/application)
2. Launch an OSPool instance through Jupyter Lab [here](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/jupyter/).
3. Clone this github repository to the OSPool instance.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook `osg.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
